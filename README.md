# Lambda_Calculus_Interpreter
An interactive console for lambda calculus.

## Clone the project

```bash
  $ git clone https://github.com/youssef-chaabouni/Lambda_Calculus_Interpreter
```

## Usage

### Run the interpreter
Once you clone project (section <b>"Clone the project"</b> above), you can preceed to creating the executable for the Lambda Calculus Interpreter:

<ol>
  <li>
Move into the project directory:

```bash
  $ cd Lambda_Calculus_Interpreter
```
  </li>
  <li>
Compile the project:

```bash
  $ make
```
  </li>
  <li>
Run the interpreter:

```bash
  $ ./MyLambda
```
  </li>
</ol>

### Commands

Two types of commands are supported by the interpreter:

<ul>
  <li>
  <b>Variable definition:</b><br>
  Variables can be defined using either of the syntaxes:

```
  > 'variable_name' = 'expression'
```
or

```
  > let 'variable_name' = 'expression'
```
  where:
  - `'variable_name'` stands for the name of the variable.
  - `'expression'` stands for the Lambda-expression we want to assign.
  
  Once the variable is defined, it can then be used to refer to the assigned expression in the rest of the interaction with the interpreter (unless it is shadowed by another assignment).
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Expression evaluation:</b><br>
  Expressions can be evaluated using the syntax:

```
  > 'expression'
```
  where `'expression'` stands for the Lambda-expression we want to assign.
  
  This will evaluate the expression to its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_normal_form">beta-normal form</a>, and print the result.
  </li>
</ul>

### Quit the interpreter

You can quit the interpreter by either of the commands:

```
  > :quit
```

or

```
  > :q
```
